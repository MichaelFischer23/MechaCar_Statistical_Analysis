#### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
According to the regression that was run all wheel drive (AWD), spoiler angle, and vehicle weight provided the most to the mpg values in the dataset.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The intercept is not equal to zero, since it has a value it can not be considered zero.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This linear modle is effective at predicting mpg of the prototypes. The multiple R-squared value is at 72% which is statistcally significant.
